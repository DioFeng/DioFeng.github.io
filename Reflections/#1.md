# Reflection#1

- When I was in high school, I never really thought about myself stepping into the field of computer science. I wouldn’t change my desire major from psychology to computer science if weren’t for my high school Media teacher Mr. Jen. He showed me the possibilities of what I can do with codes, just like our school’s motto saying “change the world from here”. At first I was attracted to the world of hackers. I thought it would be really cool to show off to people that I know how to hack the school’s internet or something similar like that. But after I took my CS course at USF, I realized that you can do more than hacking. It is also because of the environment and people in USf, especially the professors at the CS department. I genuinely enjoy the vibes and how close you can interact with professors to get help from(maybe because I am an introvert as well, I don’t like big crowds😬). That’s why I am firmly determined to pursue degrees in computer science.

- It was mind-changing that I started to pay attention to jobs like software development engineer, back-end developer, and game developer. I imagined myself one day working for big companies such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and maybe Riots if Riots are interested in the games I planned to bring to the world some day. When I graduated college, I would most likely look for a job in SDE first because that’s really what is in my mind at the moment. After maybe a few years spent in the tech industry, I would change my pursuit into something more theoretical and practical at the same time. The reason for that is because I am passionate about AI and Sci-Fi movies. I always wanted to bring all those fancy technologies to the real world which could benefit a lot of people(it could also have some consequences too!😫).

- There’re also memories at USF while I was pursuing computer science, I got to meet people from different cultures and backgrounds. So that I know that I am not alone. I have many friends who are in computer science as well. We often support each other and help each other out. All those nights we spent together at the libraries catching up deadlines(maybe I shouldn’t mention these😂) and working on difficult projects, it was truly memorable. I am often said as the “smart kid” because I am studying both computer science and math(minor), but I never really consider myself entitled to that. Sometimes, imposter syndrome popped out and reminded me that maybe I am not good enough, and I just keep working hard to achieve the goals I made.

  Identities

  ```
  I used to have an identity crisis because my cultural background was complicated. 
  My parents and I are 100% Chinese, but I was born in a small island named American Samoa.
  I grew up in different places throughout my entire life: China, American Samoa, and now San Francisco.
  I have been exposed to many cultures, I often ponder questions:who am I? Which society should I feel belong to?
  Sometimes I feel like I am an American, but I am also Asian because I spent 15 years in China. 
  Practically I am a mixture of multi-cultures, but living in between societies that belongs to neither.

# Professional Identity
  - [ ] As an Computer Scientist
  - [ ] As an Software Development Engineer
  ```
  As I slowly stepped into the field of computer science, I am assured that this is the path I want to continue on.
  Not only because I want to devote myself to do something beneficial to the world, but also the thrills of creating
  something by using codes. I genuinely enjoy that feeling when I am coding. My goal is to become a SDE or a game
  developer, I used to doubt myself, but as I progressively learned more new skills and made more connections with
  people that shared similar interest, I realized that I am more valuable and worthy than I thought I was.

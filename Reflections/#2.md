# Entry
  There're many things that I've learned from these useful resources, but there's one thing I think is the most essential and important element in a mentor-mentee relationship: bornedries. I realized that this would be a professional relationship, mentor and mentee are meant to be working together to achieve some goals. When consulting opinions from the mentor, we should build up boundaries and respect each other. We should have certain acknowledgement that the mentor is not capable of answering or helping every aspect of the menteeâ€™s needs. As a mentee, we should always be prepared, be on time, and be able to finish any agreements or tasks that are set for.

# Questions
- How do I develop a professional SDE mindset and skill sets?
- What advice or experience you can share when stepping into tech industries?
- What do you expect from mentee and what do you hope for to get from the mentor-mentee relationship?
